/** this file demonstrates an example of how you should import the url/relative-paths of your monaco-workers.
 * 
 * in the bundled code, the import statements made at the beginning will be replaced with string variables.
 * 
 * for instance, the following import:
 * ```ts
 * import editorWorkerUrl from "monaco-editor/esm/vs/editor/editor.worker.js" with { type: "monaco-worker" }
 * ```
 * 
 * will transform to the following relative-path string in the bundled code:
 * ```ts
 * var editorWorkerUrl = "./editor.worker-4DUWL7QZ.js"
 * ```
 * 
 * and now, to resolve the `editorWorkerUrl` path relative to _this_ script's bundled form, as a full http url,
 * you will want to use `import.meta.resolve`:
 * ```ts
 * const editorWorkerFullUrl = import.meta.resolve(editorWorkerUrl)
 * const editorWorker = new Worker(editorWorkerFullUrl)
 * ```
 * 
 * you may wonder if you can simply pass the relative-path of `editorWorkerUrl` to the `new Worker` constructor,
 * and the answer is **NO**, you can't do that.
 * that's because the worker constructor **MUST** always be provided with an absolute url,
 * otherwise it will fail and leave a cryptic error message on your console that is not easy to figure out.
 * 
 * @module
